This is my first readme file ever.

This is a website project for Odin Project. I will build a simple website that will link to some recipes. This will demonstrate skills I have learned in the past 2 days while going through Odin Project. 

I will demonstrate Terminal commands:
    -creating directories/files
    -opening files in VSCode

I will demonstrate VSCode:
    -writing HTML in VScode

I will demonstrate writing HTML code:
    -writing boilerplate from scratch
    -adding links with simple style/organization

I will demonstrate pushing changes to GitHub:
    -making local changes and commit with Git
    -writing commit changelog and pushing to GitHub


I hope it looks great in the end!
